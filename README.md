cosyJS
======

Full stack UI component library

# Intro

The idea to cosyJS is to provide you out of the box a node.js server which manage all your static files (stylesheets, javascript templates).

cosyJS has also some nice features out of the box like:

* A layout generator using Bootstrap (and later Foundation and Cosy Grid Stystem)
* A powerfull client-Side library which allows you to play easily with your HTML and/or the cosyJS components. 
* A library of full-stack library which has a set of common components you use all the time (text, button, image).

# Shared Templates

The idea behind cosy is to shared the Templates you use to render your data between client-side and server-side. cosyJS is server agnostic and could work out of the box with any kind of API.

# Work in progress

This is still currenly in development but you are free to collaborate on the project.

Here is a list of task you could do:

* Create new full-stack components
* Improve performance
* Share your opinion and comment
